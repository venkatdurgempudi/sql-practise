## Below is DDL & DML for the `CUSTOMERS` and `ORDERS` tables.  



### **DDL for `CUSTOMERS` Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (
    CUSTOMER_ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    FIRST_NAME VARCHAR2(50),
    LAST_NAME VARCHAR2(50),
    EMAIL VARCHAR2(100),
    CITY VARCHAR2(50),
    ACCOUNT_CREATION_DATE DATE
);
```

### **DDL for `ORDERS` Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE ORDERS (
    ORDER_ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    CUSTOMER_ID NUMBER,
    ORDER_DATE DATE,
    ORDER_AMOUNT NUMBER(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (CUSTOMER_ID) REFERENCES CUSTOMERS(CUSTOMER_ID)
);
```


### **Complete Dataset (DML for `CUSTOMERS` Table - 200 rows)**

INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, CITY, ACCOUNT_CREATION_DATE)

-- Repeat similar inserts to create a total of 200 customers

-- Auto-generate customer data using a loop in your preferred method
-- Example for generating a few rows at a time:
DECLARE
    v_id NUMBER := 6;
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 1..195 LOOP
        INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (CUSTOMER_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, CITY, ACCOUNT_CREATION_DATE)
        VALUES (v_id, 'Customer'||i, 'Last'||i, 'customer'||i||'@example.com', 'City'||MOD(i, 5), SYSDATE - i*30);
        v_id := v_id + 1;
    END LOOP;
END;
/
```


### **Complete Dataset (DML for `ORDERS` Table - 200 rows)**

```sql
INSERT INTO ORDERS (ORDER_ID, CUSTOMER_ID, ORDER_DATE, ORDER_AMOUNT)
VALUES (101, 1, TO_DATE('15-JAN-2021', 'DD-MON-YYYY'), 1500.75);

INSERT INTO ORDERS (ORDER_ID, CUSTOMER_ID, ORDER_DATE, ORDER_AMOUNT)
VALUES (102, 2, TO_DATE('20-MAR-2020', 'DD-MON-YYYY'), 250.00);

INSERT INTO ORDERS (ORDER_ID, CUSTOMER_ID, ORDER_DATE, ORDER_AMOUNT)
VALUES (103, 3, TO_DATE('25-FEB-2021', 'DD-MON-YYYY'), 980.60);

INSERT INTO ORDERS (ORDER_ID, CUSTOMER_ID, ORDER_DATE, ORDER_AMOUNT)
VALUES (104, 1, TO_DATE('10-AUG-2021', 'DD-MON-YYYY'), 520.45);

INSERT INTO ORDERS (ORDER_ID, CUSTOMER_ID, ORDER_DATE, ORDER_AMOUNT)
VALUES (105, 4, TO_DATE('12-NOV-2021', 'DD-MON-YYYY'), 2200.10);

-- Repeat similar inserts to create a total of 200 orders
DECLARE
    v_id NUMBER := 106;
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 1..195 LOOP
        INSERT INTO ORDERS (ORDER_ID, CUSTOMER_ID, ORDER_DATE, ORDER_AMOUNT)
        VALUES (v_id, MOD(i, 200) + 1, SYSDATE - i*15, ROUND(DBMS_RANDOM.VALUE(100, 5000), 2));
        v_id := v_id + 1;
    END LOOP;
